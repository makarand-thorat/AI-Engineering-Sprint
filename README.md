# 🚀 30-Day AI Engineering Sprint

This repository documents my journey through the **AI Engineering Sprint 2026**, moving from basic LLM calls to complex, production-ready AI agents.

---

## 🛠 Global Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.13
- **Model:** Google Gemini 3.0 Flash (via `google-genai`)
- **Environment Management:** Virtual Environments (`venv`) & `python-dotenv`

---

## 📅 Day 1: Structured Meeting Extraction
**Goal:** Transform messy transcripts into machine-readable data.

- **Folder:** `/01_meeting_extractor`
- **Core Concept:** Using **Pydantic** and **Instructor** to enforce a schema on LLM outputs.
- **Outcome:** Extracts tasks, owners, priorities, and meeting sentiment into a structured JSON format.

## 📅 Day 2: RAG-Based Transcript Chatbot
**Goal:** Chat with long documents without hitting context limits.

- **Folder:** `/02_chat_with_transcript`
- **Core Concept:** **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.
- **Key Features:**
  - **Recursive Chunking:** Splitting text into overlapping segments using `langchain-text-splitters`.
  - **Contextual Retrieval:** A keyword-based search engine to find the most relevant transcript part for a user's question.
  - **Grounded Responses:** The AI is instructed to answer *only* based on the provided transcript chunks, reducing hallucinations.
